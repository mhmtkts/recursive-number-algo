# Recursive Number Algorithm

This project implements a recursive algorithm in Go that takes an integer input and generates a specific output based on the defined logic.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── main.go          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── algorithm
│   │   └── recursive.go # Implementation of the recursive function
│   └── tests
│       └── recursive_test.go # Unit tests for the recursive function
├── go.mod               # Module definition for the Go project
├── .gitignore           # Files and directories to be ignored by Git

```

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the application using the command:

   ```
   go run src/main.go
   ```

## Algorithm Details

The recursive function is designed to take an integer as input and produce an output based on specific criteria. The implementation can be found in `src/algorithm/recursive.go`.

## Testing

Unit tests for the recursive function are located in `src/tests/recursive_test.go`. You can run the tests using the command:

```
go test ./src/tests -v
```
